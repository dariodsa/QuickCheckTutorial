Hello and welcome to the [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) tutorial. This project will present the introduction to QuickCheck from basic stuff to the more advanced. We will be covering QuickCheck 2.16. version so if you have some other version be aware that some parts of code might not work.
